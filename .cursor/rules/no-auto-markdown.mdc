# Markdown File Creation Policy

## Do Not Create New Markdown Files Automatically

**NEVER proactively create new markdown files** such as:
- README.md
- CHANGELOG.md
- CONTRIBUTING.md
- Documentation files (*.md)
- Any other markdown files

This includes:
- When completing code tasks
- When setting up new projects
- When making changes to existing code
- As part of "best practices" or "helpful additions"

## Updating Existing Markdown Files

**It is OK to update existing markdown files** as part of your coding work if:
- The file already exists in the codebase
- The update is relevant to the code changes being made
- The update keeps the documentation accurate and in sync with the code

## When New Markdown Files ARE Allowed

Only create new markdown files when:
1. The user **explicitly requests** creation of a markdown file
2. The user asks for documentation to be written
3. The user specifically mentions creating a README, CHANGELOG, or other .md file

## Examples

❌ **DON'T DO THIS:**
- User: "Create a new Python module for data processing"
- Agent: Creates module.py AND automatically creates README.md

✅ **DO THIS:**
- User: "Create a new Python module for data processing"
- Agent: Creates only module.py

✅ **THIS IS ALSO FINE:**
- User: "Add a new API endpoint for user authentication"
- Agent: Creates the endpoint AND updates existing API.md with the new endpoint details

✅ **THIS IS FINE TOO:**
- User: "Create a README for the data processing module"
- Agent: Creates README.md as explicitly requested
